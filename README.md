# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Here you can find the instructions for the challenge. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them any time.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to build an questioneer app asking the user random questions from a list of questions. Your challenge is to build it within the next two hours and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.

The user should be able to:

- See how many question there are left to answer
- See how many questions they have answered correctly / incorrectly
- See a visual indicator if they answered the question correctly or incorrectly
- Questions are asked in random order
- Get asked all questions but each question only once

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

You will find the data for the questions in the `/data` folder. The data contains 20 questions in total.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
